Self Note: 

How to Solve wired controller issue:
Important: the fact that a character will spin is because there are techniquely 5 controllers, one is emulated as a xbox360 controller.
The fake "wireless controller" is the defected one.
What to do: change the joy num of the spinning character until the spinning stops.

In case of ps4 controller "yellow light of death issue":
go to devices, and "delete the driver of the controller". THEN open DS4 windows, THEN REPLUG the controller. Should be connected after 
admin prompt.
